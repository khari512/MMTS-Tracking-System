# MMTS-Tracking-System
This is a system for Hyderabad MMTS tracking , time table ,price details and all info required for MMTS trains.

Background:
I was used commute to office by MMTS train from 2011 to 2014 in Hyderabad. Most of the time MMTS trains will be delyed by 15 to 60 mins and passengers have no  idea about these delays.So passengers used to waste lot of time waiting for the trains.
One day I thought why dont someone (probably who already in the trains or station vendors,railway employees) share me the location of the train,so that I dont need to wait in the stations.

This is when I thought of developing a system where people can share status of the trains, so that others can see that and plan their journey accordingly.So I started doing reach on developing and hosting a website and decided to go with google app engine as it is free.
I wroked on this aggressevly for few months, developed most of the modules but unfortunatley I couldn't get the time to spend on this project.

I thought of putting this github, so that some one can extend it or use as practise project.
